## Learning Objectives - The student should be able to..

* Complete this lab which challenges them on what they have learned about arrays up to this point.
* This should actually reflect what it is we're looking to cover here (similar to the outlines provided in the labs I mentioned in the outline below).

## What the student can do at this point 

* Create variables and constants
* Is familiar with type annotations, type inference and string interpolation.
* Can create functions with return types.
* Is familiar with the String, Int, Double, and Bool type.
* Can perform arithmetic operations on Int and Double.
* Understands if and else clause statements.
* Can create and use Arrays.
* Can iterate over an Array using a for-in loop.
* Can iterate over an Array calling enumerate().
* Work with the following methods on arrays:
	* `append()`
	* `insert(_:atIndex:)`
	* `removeAtIndex()`
	* *subscript syntax* with arrays
	* `count`
	* `isEmpty`
	
## Outline / Notes

* **Feel free** to design to design the lab and have it include UI Stuff similar to the following Labs:
 * [Lab using Storyboard](https://github.com/learn-co-curriculum/swift-viewLifeCycle-lab)
 * [Dictionary Lab Outline](https://github.com/learn-co-curriculum/swift-dictionaryBillOrSteve-lab)

*  I'm including labs written for the iOS immersive course here that you can reference (or flat our steal) They were written in Objective-C which this course is not! They are labs that students seemed to like in the immersive program. They also serve as a good reference for what a **lab** actually should look like. You can see how we structure the lab with regards to the instructions as well as how the tests are written.
* [WWDC Badges With Methods - OBJ-C](https://learn.co/tracks/ios-new/objective-c-basics/basic-structures/wwdc-badges-with-methods)
* [Deli Counter Lab - OBJ-C](https://learn.co/tracks/ios-new/objective-c-basics/basic-structures/deli-counter)
* [Array Practice - OBJ-C](https://github.com/learn-co-curriculum/objc-array-practice)
* [Boat - SWIFT](https://github.com/learn-co-curriculum/swift-boat) <-- This is not a lab about arrays, but it is a lab written in Swift where you can reference how the the tests were written using Quick & Nimble.

* I've included the Xcode project which includes the Quick & Nimble frameworks installed using CocoaPods. You should work within the .xcworkspace file, NOT the project file.
